This site was generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) by a person called [lannon](http://github.com/lannon).

It's name was inspired by a David Bowie song about folks crawling into televisions. It appears on his [Station to Station](https://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Station-To-Station/release/374969) record, which everyone should own. 

It uses the [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) CSS framework.
