This site was generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) by a person called [lannon](http://github.com/lannon).

It's name was inspired by a David Bowie song about folks crawling into televisions. It appears on his [Station to Station](https://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Station-To-Station/release/374969) record, which is really good even though its creator may have been indulging fascist fantasies during its production. In spite of his protests, it probably was the side effects of the cocaine. 

It uses the [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) CSS framework.

Icon SVGs are from the [IcoMoon Free icon set](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select)
